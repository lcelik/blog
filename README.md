### Project Objective

Women in Tech Blog allows users to register, log in and publish their articles/blogs. Blogs and user details can be edited or deleted. At the end user can also log out.

### Background

According to the recent Tech Nation report only 19% of people working in tech in UK are women  
My project idea was to create a platform (blog) for women to share their experience and to be united and
supported on the journey into tech industry.

### Technology

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. For the front-end l used JavaScript, JSX, SASS, Axios, contect API, gitHub and Figma for design. The back-end has been created with Express and Node.js. I have made my own rest API and routes. Data is being stored/fetched using MongoDB.
